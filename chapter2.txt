The Dark Hedges are an avenue of beech trees near Armoy in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. Planted in the late 18th century for the Gracehill House estate of James Stuart, the trees form an atmospheric "tunnel" and became a tourist attraction after its use as a filming location in the HBO television series Game of Thrones. This photograph of the Dark Hedges was taken in 2016.
